For me, a visit to Italy is an opportunity to imagine the passage of time. Archaeological sites, statues, fountains, art, and architecture are layered on top of one another from Etruscan time to the present, exposed for all to see. The geology of the Italian peninsula, raised above sea level by tectonic forces some 5 million years ago, is the floor over which the layers of human history are draped. The modern world sits at the top of the stack with its hustle and bustle, bobblehead figurines in the likeness of Pope Francis, autogrills, and cellphone users capturing one Pokemon after the other.  You can sit at a cafe in Campo dei Fiori next to a statue of Giordano Bruno, enjoying a Campari spritz, while downloading data from a NASA satellite on your Macbook Air. And, here, more clearly than anywhere else I have been, you can feel time fleeting away. It travels so fast that days feel like hours. Espresso, work/news/tour, lunch, nap, shop, wine, dinner, and bam! "Where the hell did this day go?" Just ask anyone who has taken a holiday to Rome, Florence, Venice; they will surely tell you that time ran out before they saw all of the sites on their itinerary.  

The Dalmatian islands of Croatia are more of a journey to a particular point in time. Its true that the same layers of history are present, but they somehow feel more compressed into a single layer, one time period unchanged over millennia. Time, here, elapses slowly.  

To say that the water along the coast is turquoise in color is incorrect. The water is crystal clear, nearly invisible.  The color arises from the white sea floor and vegetation below.  

A fisherman's net is draped carefully over polished white steps that lead from the coast into the red-roofed city above, while a web of limestone walls, built rock by rock over hundreds of years time, blankets the hills in the background. Pine trees along the coast shed their fragrant needles and invoke that feeling you get when camping in the mountains.

These hilly islands are imbricated slivers of the Adira carbonate platform, which has been folded and thrust northeastward since Eocene time. The Dubrivnik earthquake of 1667 and modern GPS measurements provide evidence that Adria continues to collide with the Dinarides to the east.  

21st century problems.

I am not the kind of blogger who is going to chronicle every detail of my travels. Below, please find instead a short list of vignettes or highlights from the past couple of days island hopping on a sail boat in central Dalmatia.    

1. After a shower at the marina in Maslinica, a tall can of Staropramen, and a needed nap on the boat, we left for dinner. While we were goofing off with such activities, our skipper Vinko was doing the important work; he had arranged for us to dine at a small family restaurant in the interior village of Grohote. The restaurant owner himself picked us up just above the marina at 19:15 hours. We reached the konoba after a 10 or 15 minute ride up the mountain in his 1985 two-door Yugo. In case you are curious, we ate grilled lubin with a side of chard.  And yes, it  awesome.  

1. When grilled fish is served whole, it behooves one to either know or ask how to proceed.

1. Plavac mali is a grape that makes a spectacular wine. The best grapes for wine come from the interior part of the islands, which are drier and not subject to sea spray. Those who know me will not ask "red or white?", because spectacular could only mean red.  
1. A large number of guidebooks discuss the ins and outs of the harbor towns on Dalmatia island hotspots, but I have yet to find one that adequately describes the true gems one can find in the interior towns on these islands.  And I am okay with that.    

1. Olive oil and wine taste better when made by people who care about the quality of the product.

1. Tuesday night in Komiza: A large group of youth people congregate around midnight on a peer built of limestone blocks built by Austro-Hungarians...about 10 meters from where our boat was docked. They sing a sampling of songs from the Beatles catalog, accompanied by an acoustic guitar. Flutes and other instruments that lie on the wind-instrument spectrum somewhere between flutes and kazoos, filled the spaces between songs with  jingles first perfected by snake charmers.
